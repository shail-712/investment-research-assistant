Export Restrictions On April 15, 2025, the Company completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the U.S. government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent in such countries (the Export Control). The Export Control applies to the Company\u2019s MI308 products. The Company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted. The Company expects that the Export Control may result in charges of approximately $800 million in inventory and related reserves. Tax Matters The Company previously submitted claims to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking reasonable cause relief related to dual consolidated losses. On April 17, 2025, the IRS approved the Company\u2019s request for relief. The relief, as approved, is estimated to favorably impact the Company\u2019s tax provision in fiscal year 2025 by approximately $900 million. Table of Contents ITEM 2."

Net revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2025 was $7.4 billion, a 36% increase compared to the prior year period. The increase in net revenue was driven by an increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by growth in AMD EPYC\u2122 CPU and AMD Instinct\u2122 GPU sales, and an increase in Client and Gaming segment revenue primarily driven by strong demand for the latest \u201cZen 5\u201d AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors and a richer mix, partially offset by a decrease in semi-custom revenue. Embedded segment revenue decreased as demand in end markets remained mixed. Gross margin for the three months ended March 29, 2025 was 50% compared to gross margin of 47% for the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was driven by higher Data Center segment revenue and a richer mix of Ryzen processor sales."

Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. We offer products that are used in different end markets and the demand for our products can vary among our Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded end markets. For instance, in our Data Center segment, we offer products that are optimized for generative AI applications and in 2024, we experienced significant demand for our AI accelerators. The demand for such products in part will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize generative AI solutions in a wide variety of applications, and both the near-term and long-term trajectory of such generative AI solutions is unknown."

We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Operational and Technology Risks We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd."

We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyberattacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency."

In January 2025, BIS issued a final rule, commonly referred to as the \u201cAI Diffusion Rule,\u201d that imposes new restrictions on the export, reexport and in-country transfer of certain advanced semiconductor devices and technology.

In general, limits on sales of our offerings in the China market due to export controls puts us in a competitive disadvantage compared to domestic Chinese competitors and other unrestricted companies. In January 2025, BIS issued a final rule, commonly referred to as the \u201cAI Diffusion Rule,\u201d that imposes new restrictions on the export, reexport and in-country transfer of certain advanced semiconductor devices and technology. The rule seeks to control the spread of advanced AI technology in a manner that promotes its potential economic and social benefits, while also protecting U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. It expands licensing requirements worldwide for transactions involving entities or end uses associated with the development or proliferation of AI capabilities. The rule, if implemented as currently drafted on its May 15, 2025 compliance date, may limit our ability to engage in certain business transactions, require new export licenses, delay shipments, or necessitate changes in our compliance processes and product designs to ensure regulatory compliance. Additionally, the rule introduces uncertainty as we evaluate whether specific products, technologies, or software fall within the scope of the new restrictions, and whether BIS will grant licenses in a timely matter or at all. Compliance with the AI Diffusion Rule could result in increased costs, disruption of key customer and supplier relationships, loss of competitive positioning in international markets or reputational harm. The implementation or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result in lost sales and adversely impact our reputation and business. The U.S. government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include higher tariffs on imports into the U.S."

    "text": "testing of our products is performed at third-party operated manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. Our shipping services are provided by third-party subcontractors. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 66% for the three months ended March 29, 2025. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; imposition of new and increased tariffs; worsening trade relationship between the United States and China (or other countries); volatile global economic conditions, including downturns or recessions in which some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Changes in the public perception of the U.S. government in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could also negatively impact our business and results of operations."

Changes in the public perception of the U.S. government in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could also negatively impact our business and results of operations. Recently, the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. The Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could have negative impacts on the global economy and financial markets. Also, in addition to restrictions imposed by the United States or China on exports or imports from one another, geopolitical changes between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adversely affect delivery of products and our business, financial condition and/or operating results. In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, tropical cyclones, droughts, fires, sea-level rise, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our California operations are located near major earthquake fault lines. In April 2024, Taiwan experienced an earthquake where our third-party wafer foundries are located."

Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements 8 Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements | | Table of Contents \u25aa Segment expenses: consists of direct expenses for technology development, product manufacturing and services provided by Intel Foundry to internal and external customers, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Direct expenses for product manufacturing include excess capacity charges, if any. All Other Our \"all other\" category includes the results of operations from other non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including our Mobileye business, our IMS business, start up businesses that support our initiatives, and historical results of operations from divested businesses, including Altera. Effective September 12, 2025, Altera, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary, was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements following the closing of the sale of 51% of Altera's issued and outstanding common stock. Altera's financial results of operations were included in our \"all other\" category through September 11, 2025. As of September 12, 2025, our retained interest in Altera is accounted for as an equity method investment. See \"Note 9: Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. The financial results of our \"all other\" category include intersegment product and services revenue and intersegment expenses primarily between Altera and our Intel Foundry segment.

We centrally manage all procurement, treasury, and asset management functions across the enterprise and do not maintain separate balance sheets by segment within our systems of record, nor does our CODM receive total asset information by segment for purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources. Intersegment eliminations: Intersegment sales and related gross profit on inventory recorded at the end of the period or sold through to third-party customers is eliminated for consolidation purposes. The Intel Products operating segments and Intel Foundry are meant to reflect separate fabless semiconductor and foundry companies, respectively. Thus, certain intersegment activity is captured within the intersegment eliminations upon consolidation and presented at the Intel consolidated level.

As a result of modifying our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024, we reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis.

Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on each investor's respective ownership of Ireland SCIP, of which Intel's is 51%. Ireland SCIP has rights to factory output of an Intel owned wafer fabrication plant in Ireland (Fab 34) and rights to resell the factory output to us. We retain sole ownership of Fab 34 and we are engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output."

Though we expect certain construction delays in the near term, we intend to complete construction of Fab 34. We will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP, or we will be subject to certain volume-related damages payable to Ireland SCIP, beginning at the earlier of when construction is complete or the third quarter of 2027. As of September 27, 2025, other than cash and cash equivalents held by Ireland SCIP, most of the remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.

At September 27, 2025, the fair value of the Escrowed Shares was $5.6 billion, which we have recognized within other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The $2.3 billion previously received under the DFA and Secure Enclave programs prior to the August 22, 2025 U.S. Government Agreement date remained subject to our government grant accounting policy. See \u201cNote 5: Other Financial Statement Details\u201d within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further discussion. In the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025, we released 684 thousand Escrowed Shares upon our receipt of certain of the cash proceeds for our performance under Secure Enclave. The remaining 79 million Escrowed Shares that were not contingently issuable based on the terms of the U.S. Government Agreement have been included in our computation of basic earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025. The remaining 79 million Escrowed Shares are considered contingently issuable based on the DOC's disbursements under Secure Enclave and therefore will be excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share until the contingencies are met. Potentially dilutive shares issuable under the Warrant have been excluded from all basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 as the Warrants are neither currently nor expected to become exercisable.

We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC's 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the \u20ac1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022."

The plaintiffs in the derivative lawsuits seek to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. The cases are stayed pending developments in the securities class action lawsuit. Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business. VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP)."

In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court's rejection of Intel's claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group's acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and sent the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI's patents."

In YTD 2025, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.2 billion, consisting primarily of charges from our initiating and deploying the 2025 Restructuring Plan and including some remaining charges as we substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan. Charges in YTD 2025 were primarily composed of cash-based employee severance and related employee exit charges of $1.8 billion and non-cash asset impairment charges of $416 million resulting from the exit of certain non-core lines of business and the consolidation and exit of certain real estate properties. Our YTD 2025 results of operations were also affected by accelerated depreciation and impairment charges recognized for certain manufacturing assets that were determined to have no remaining operational use. This determination was based on an evaluation of our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services.

We are focused on the continued development of Intel 14A, the next generation node beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P, and on securing a significant external customer for such node. However, if we are unable to secure a significant external customer and meet important customer milestones for Intel 14A, we face the prospect that it will not be economical to develop and manufacture Intel 14A and successor leading-edge nodes on a go-forward basis.

MD&A Table of Contents Risks to Operations from Hostilities in Israel During YTD 2025, hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region escalated significantly, including direct military actions between Israel and Iran and military strikes by the United States against Iran. While a truce was recently reached among parties to the conflict in Israel, there can be no assurance that any existing or future ceasefire agreements will be respected or remain in force, and additional hostilities and escalations remain possible at any time."

    "text": "produced internally or by an external foundry. If we were to discontinue development of Intel 14A and successor nodes, we expect that a majority of our products would continue to be manufactured in our own facilities utilizing our nodes up to Intel 18A-P through at least 2030. By focusing on our customers and delivering the best semiconductor products to the market, manufactured on the most appropriate internal or external node from a performance and cost perspective, and only deploying capital on new nodes and manufacturing facilities where we believe they will yield an attractive return, we believe we can improve the competitiveness of our products business, and the overall financial results for the company. MD&A Table of Contents Risks to Operations from Hostilities in Israel During YTD 2025, hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region escalated significantly, including direct military actions between Israel and Iran and military strikes by the United States against Iran. While a truce was recently reached among parties to the conflict in Israel, there can be no assurance that any existing or future ceasefire agreements will be respected or remain in force, and additional hostilities and escalations remain possible at any time. We continue to monitor the impact this geopolitical conflict could have on our operations in Israel, including potential disruption of our wafer fabrication facility and our product development centers. To date, we have not had a material interruption in either our manufacturing operations or our product development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are not insured for business interruptions resulting from war or political violence, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business."

Intersegment revenue was $13.2 billion, up $364 million from YTD 2024, primarily due to higher back end services revenue, and higher wafer volume from our Intel 3 and Intel 4 process nodes, partially offset by lower intersegment sample revenue. External revenue was $85 million, down $22 million from YTD 2024. Segment Operating Loss Summary Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 Operating loss was $2.3 billion in Q3 2025, compared to an operating loss of $5.8 billion in Q3 2024, primarily driven by the absence of $3.1 billion of non-cash asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges recognized in Q3 2024, which were related to manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node. Additionally, Q3 2025 benefited from $421 million of lower operating expenses in Q3 2025, primarily due to lower payroll-related expenditures as a result of headcount reductions taken under the 2025 and 2024 Restructuring Plans and the effects of various cost-reduction measures. YTD 2025 vs. YTD 2024 Operating loss was $7.8 billion in YTD 2025, compared to an operating loss of $11.0 billion in YTD 2024. The YTD 2025 change was primarily driven by the reduced impacts of $797 million in charges recognized in Q2 2025 related to certain manufacturing assets that were determined to have no remaining operational use based on an evaluation of our current process technology node capacities and projected market demand for our products and services in comparison to $3.1 billion of non-cash asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges recognized in Q3 2024, as described above."

These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio, and may also include longer-term projects. As described in the introduction of this MD&A section, in Q3 2025 we entered into and/or concluded upon certain investing and financing transactions including the Altera divestiture and retained equity investment; an amendment to our CHIPs Act commercial agreement, which accelerated $5.7 billion of funding to us; and private placement share sales agreements. In Q3 2025, we received net proceeds of $922 million from the net sale of 57.5 million of our Mobileye Class A shares. See \"Note 3: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. In Q1 2025, we closed the second phase of our NAND memory business divestiture and received $1.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of certain adjustments. See \"Note 9: Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. MD&A Table of Contents Our total cash and short-term investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions."

In Q1 2025, we amended our 364-day $8.0 billion credit facility agreement to $5.0 billion and the maturity date was extended by one year to January 2026. Additionally, we have access to our $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which remains available until February 2029.

(b) Special Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 5.2: (i) Minimum Gain Chargeback."

In the absence of a timely election, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to have the dividends with respect to which an election is offered accumulated in the Participant\u2019s Accounts and reinvested in the Intel Stock Fund. The Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, adopt administrative rules and procedures applicable to the administration of this Section 12(b)(ii). (iii) Diversification Requirements under Code section 401(a)(35). The Plan shall comply with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(35). In this regard, with respect to a Participant (including for this purpose an alternate payee who has an Account under the Plan or a deceased Participant\u2019s Beneficiary), if any portion of the Participant\u2019s Account under the Plan attributable to elective deferrals, employee contributions, or rollover contributions is invested in Intel Stock, then the Participant shall be offered the opportunity to elect to divest those shares and reinvest an equivalent amount in other investment options as described below."

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.9% and 13.5% for the third quarter, and 15.3% and 13.6% for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and U.S. federal research tax credit relative to the increase in income before income tax. Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit. In July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. We have recognized the tax effects of currently effective OBBBA provisions, which are not material and are reflected in our results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026. Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information."

The agreement allows our partner to secure a limited-availability facility lease backed by our credit profile, in exchange for issuing us warrants. The maximum gross exposure is $860 million, which is reduced as the partner makes payments to the lessor over five years. The partner has placed $470 million in escrow and executed an agreement to sell the data center cloud capacity, mitigating our default risk. If the escrow and cloud capacity agreement are not sufficient to cover an event of default, we have the option to assume the lease for internal use or sublease.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Our Blackwell architectures are the majority of our Data Center revenue. The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance. Expanding energy capacity to meet demand is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges. In addition, access to capital can be particularly constrained for less-capitalized companies, which may face difficulties securing financing for large-scale infrastructure projects. These limitations could delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption. We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence."

We are increasing our U.S.-based manufacturing and investing in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to strengthen our supply chain, add resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis. Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments."

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 due to higher revenue. Cash used in investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by higher purchases of non-marketable equity securities and higher purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, mainly due to higher share repurchases. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. As of October 26, 2025, we had $60.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future obligations. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements. Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly-rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars."

Risk Factors Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 27, 2025 and July 27, 2025. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 27, 2025 and July 27, 2025, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Long manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and capacity availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended."

Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.

Publicly announced intentions by governments or other companies to purchase our products can further complicate our demand estimates, as such announcements are often non binding and may not result in committed volumes. We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our data center products.

In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we may not be able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. We expect to continue investing in strategic partnerships. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, we entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI. In November 2025, we entered into an agreement, subject to certain closing conditions, to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic. There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all. The timing and magnitude of these and other investments we may make will depend on various factors, including the ability of our partners to successfully develop and deploy AI infrastructure. There can be no certainty as to the timing or amount of capital we may ultimately invest in these or other strategic partnerships, and we may be limited by our available liquidity and capital resources. We have committed to make an equity investment in operational risks, including dependence on the partner\u2019s ability to scale production and deliver competitive technology on schedule. We may not realize the anticipated strategic benefits."

On September 15, 2025, China\u2019s antitrust regulators published their preliminary finding that our compliance with applicable U.S. export controls, which required us to offer degraded products to the Chinese market, discriminated unfairly against customers in the China market and therefore violated the terms of China\u2019s approval of our Mellanox acquisition."

    "text": "or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted \u201cConnected Vehicle\u201d restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China. Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business. Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and even if we are able to participate in the China data center compute market, increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government has encouraged customers to purchase from our China-based competitors and restricted customers from purchasing, importing, or using our data center products, including any China-specific product designed to comply with U.S. export controls. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. Although we are already effectively foreclosed from the China market by U.S. export controls, if those controls changed to allow us to return to the market, the Chinese government could modify or implement the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, which may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition."
